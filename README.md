# Lock & Key Tutorial
A Password Manager for CIS357 using on Device Storage
<h2>Overview of the Lock & Key Application and On-Device Storage</h2>
The Lock & Key application allows the user to store a list of the passwords they use directly on their phone. No need for a cloud database, the application is secured directly within the applications data on the device. The primary reason for using the on device storage is because of security. This is mentioned in Androids data and file storage <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage" target="_blank">(found here)</a>:
<br>
<br>
<strong>App-specific storage: Store files that are meant for your app's use only, either in dedicated directories within an internal storage volume or different dedicated directories within external storage. Use the directories within internal storage to save sensitive information that other apps shouldn't access.</strong>
<br>
<br>
This means that storing data directly on the device (using App-specific storage) is the most secure way of holding information. The only thing that has access to this data is the application itself. This data cannot be access anywhere else outside of the local application on the device.

First the user is greeted by a login screen. For the following examples we're going to assume the user already has an account on the phone. For this application <strong>ONLY ONE</strong> account can be on a single phone. We do not allow multiple accounts because we assume that a phone is a personal device that a single person will be using.

The user is then taken to the dashboard of the application where they can see their passwords. Currently the user does not have any passwords. So upon clicking add button (+ button) it will take the user to a password creation screen.

From here the user can create a password. Once this is done the dashboard is updated. In this example I've created two passwords. The passwords are identified by Password: Name of Password.

The user can then click on a password and for which they will be taken to a password edit screen where they can then toggle an editting mode and update their password.

The last thing a user can do from the dashboard (other than logging out) is updating their login creditentials for the app itself. This is the same page as the initial account creation page accessed from the Create Account button on the login screen. The user can edit their login credentials here.

<h2>Gettting started on your app</h2>
To start developing your app, we need to have Android Studio installed on our workstation. If you donâ€™t have Android Studio on your workstation then you can go to <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio" target="_blank">this</a> website and follow the instructions there on how to get it set up. One of the pleasant things about this application we will be able to build everything with just Android Studio. Once you have Android studio properly installed, we can start building the app!
